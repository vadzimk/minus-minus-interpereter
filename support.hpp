 Input: postFix stack created by parseEquation, local SymbolTable, and success boolean

 calculate value from the postFix stack by treating it like prefix (easy to do with a stack).

 changed: postFix

   3. The number of parmeters (numParms)

            will link up the parameter name with the
            stack offset
 Sets up needed variables and even has a whiles stack
    for use with keeping track of the top of current while
 Will do a loop with a switch statement for executing
    MinusMinus instrucions until either the boolean run
    is false or an error occurs

 input: exp, local SymbolTable, and success
 output: parse the equation in exp and create a postFix stack with operands and operators in postFix order.
 note: it will use a temporary operatorStack for operators to get the order correct. Also save lineNumber to avoid program problems
 And it will treat function calls as operands but append a FUNCTION_ARG on the front for easy recognition
 by the calculate function. Routine is recursive.
 changed: p, local, success and restore lineNumber
